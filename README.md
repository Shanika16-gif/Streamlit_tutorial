# Loan Data Visualization and Prediction App

Welcome to the Loan Data Visualization and Prediction App! This app is designed to help users explore and analyze loan data effectively while also predicting loan approval outcomes using machine learning models. The app leverages a dataset that includes various features such as applicant income, loan amount, education, and property area to provide insightful visualizations and accurate predictions.

The app preprocesses the loan dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. It then trains a RandomForestClassifier on the preprocessed data and evaluates its performance using accuracy metrics. Predictions are generated based on user inputs, providing insights into loan approval probabilities.
